I overhauled the Profile Page UI where I made the page layout into more of a grid pattern. Hopefully this new UI will be more visually interactive to end users then the beginning design. I then added boxes for future functionality as well as fleshed out user's reviews such that a user can explore their previous reviews instead of having to click through every item. 

files that I added / changed:
/lib/Widgets/Profile_box.dart 
/lib/Widgets/Profile_signout_box.dart 
/lib/Screens/PersonalAllergiesPage.dart 
/lib/Screens/PersonalReviewPage.dart 
/lib/Screens/PersonalFavoritePage.dart
