### HW04: Design
I redesigned/fixed the Item display cards on the home page to address the issue of overflowing text fields. 
Previously, the design of the home page did not address long text fields that overflowed beyond the constraints of the display
which caused both functional and aesthetic problems. After the redesign, the text is cut off and appended with ellipses automatically
to fit the contraints.
