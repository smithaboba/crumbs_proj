\### What I've completed: Installed Flutter on my machine, looked into testing options (Android Studio)
\### What I expect to get done soon: Hello World app using Flutter, work on writing `team/PROBLEM_SCENARIO` on the shared repository
\### Obstacles: Seems like it will be hard to use my iPhone for testing because I don't have a Mac, will look into options (but Android Studio emulator seems easiest for now) (edited)
