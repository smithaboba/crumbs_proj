## Spring 3 Planning Meeting

### Attendance
All Present

### Overview
In this Planning Meeting we are assigning values to each issue so that we can prioritize the most important issues first

we assigned points based on the time it would take to implement each issue then added the points to compose the stories, from there we decided which issues should be worked on first

the following points were assigned to each of the user stories:
- User Story: As a user I can log in using my google account (4 points)
- User Story: As a user, I want to view and contribute ratings / reviews of items (8 points)
- User Story: As a user, I want to add price data / deals to the app (8 points)
