## Retrospective on 11/11/23 (Sec06)
- Led by: Ryan
- Present: Matt, Ryan, Zixiao, Nick, Isaac

## Action Items
- Goal: Incorporate MVP feedback into new user stories. We want user stories on the backlog to address the feedback more directly; for now our user stories mostly consist of ideas we had before testing the MVP  
- Change: Create and work on a user story about cleaning up the UI
- Measurement: UI looks cleaner at the end of this sprint (text and formatting, more visually interesting?)
