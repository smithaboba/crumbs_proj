__Retro 01:__

# Date of Retrospective: 10/20/23

- Led by: Nicolas Guglielmin
- Present: Matt, Ryan, Isaac, Zixiao
- Absent: N/A

## Action item

- a goal: Better prioritization of issues and efficiency
- a change: We will assign agreed-upon points values to each issue
- a measurement: Get x points of a total y

## Optional

- During sprint planning, we intend to assign points to each issue and set a total point goal for the week
- This relates to our goal because it will enable us to better understand how far along we are as we try to deliver an MVP in two weeks

## Retro Assessment

* We individually suggested different goals, changes and measurements in Slack and then discussed them at the beginning of the retro. The idea to implement a points system came up during this disucssion. We then worked together to think of a broader goal that we could acheive using points.
* I think it's a good idea to have a plan for how you're going to organize the meeting, and potential questions you might ask to keep things on track.
