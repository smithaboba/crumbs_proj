I replaced the rating bar out of 5 stars with a new UI component that is more intuitive for the end user and less subjective. This way, it will be easier to map star ratings to a "positive / negative" binary value. The rating bar now uses 5 faces, which go from unhappy to happy, as well as different colors for each rating you can select (red to green). This means that people who were dissatisfied should consistently choose a value less than 3, and satisfied customers will choose three or greater.
