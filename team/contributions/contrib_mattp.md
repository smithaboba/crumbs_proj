During the project i made several contributions to the code base, I helped the team start withe the initial code base, o created the side bar so we could start using it for our different pages, I also created the first iteration of the profile page as well as integrated google Oauth into the app, I also integrated the functionality of adding a location to the item based on searching for the closest location so we could store that and later display it on the map
