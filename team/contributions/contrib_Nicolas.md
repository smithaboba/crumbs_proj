In the pull requests I have filed, I've made significant strides in improving our project's functionality and user experience. One notable addition is the integration of a map using Flutter's mapbox_gl library. Users can now easily access an interactive map through a new sidebar entry. The map dynamically populates with markers representing store locations, obtained by querying the database. On clicking these markers, users can access essential details such as the store's name and address. Additionally, I implemented a review feed in the pre-mvp app, allowing users to scroll through and view all reviews in a user-friendly format. To enhance user engagement further , a review page for specific items has been added, and I protyped a visualization of like/dislike ratios and displaying associated reviews. Moreover, I've incorporated Google OAuth for iOS to bolster authentication and security measures. These contributions collectively elevate the app's functionality and aesthetic, underscoring our commitment to delivering a polished and feature-rich user experience.
