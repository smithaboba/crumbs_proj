During the first half of the course leading up to the MVP, I worked on implementing search bars and the first variation of reviews page. During this period I also spent a considerable amount of time researching about Firebase real time functions and how we would implement them. Realizing they are mostly locked behind a payed-tier of Firebase had me pivot to other areas of the app. After the MVP, I worked on improving my assigned area of the app, profile page. I decided to revamp the layout to include better layout and experimentation with text/font/placement as well as 4 different buttons that lead to different functionalities.
