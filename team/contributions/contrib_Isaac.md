I made significant contributions to the project during the initial phase leading up to the MVP presentation, 
especially the interface between the frontend and the backend. The frontend design of the home page is also 
a product of my work during this time. After the MVP presentation, I did not contribute as much as other members
of my team except for some cosmetic changes, bug fixes, and minor features.
