During the first half of the course leading up to the MVP, I worked on the add item page and three dots pop-up menu button in each item widget in the home page. After the MVP, I worked on improving the review page, more info (item review page), personal review page, personal item page, and profile page. I added features like allowing reviews to be pushed together with userID, userName automatically, changing the rating system to five-star rating bar, showing all items information, all reviews related to the item in the more info page, implementing the favorite button, adding delete functionality to personal contributed reviews, implementing the personal item page, and making the user avatar clickable which gives account information.
