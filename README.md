# Crumbs
Crumbs is a mobile application that allows UCSB students to contribute grocery price data and find cheap groceries.  
## Description
College students often have to shop for groceries on a restricted budget, with some having to spend time visiting multiple stores to find the items that will fit in their budget. Our users will be able to contribute data on prices of items at grocery stores, as well as reviews. The app will present this crowd-sourced data back to the users, which will allow them to find the best deals on groceries and optimize their shopping experience. Since user contributions are crucial to our app, we plan to add an administrator User Role and potentially restrict the user base to people with an @ucsb.edu login. 
## User Roles
There are two types of users: the administrator and the user. The administrator can remove inappropriate content (e.g. reviews) and manage user accounts. The user can contribute price data and reviews for grocery items and look for items to retrieve information. 
## Tech Stack
Crumbs is built using the Flutter framework with a Firebase database and backend.
