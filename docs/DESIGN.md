## Important Team Decisions
- At the beginning of the quarter, we decided to use Firebase as the backend because it provided the easiest solution to user authentication, which was the most urgent feature to implement at the time.
- After the MVP demo, the team decided to focus on improving the existing User Experience before implementing additional features that were planned, taking into consideration some of the feedback that we gathered from the class.
